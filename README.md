# SUTD What-the-Hack-Hackathon-2023
First hackathon experience: 26/08/23 

# Disclaimer:
- We were unable to finish the full project due to a lack of experience and time management, and only got to making a login page. (Done by Jerry)


# PROBEM STATEMENT: Inclusivity and Accessibility Technology.
- How can we ensure that advancements in tech remanin reliable to all?


# PROBLEM THAT WE WERE TRYING TO SOLVE AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE
- There were a few websites that offered classes for elderly and citizens to go for digital upskilling workshops, but no centralised location where they can find all the available workshops.
- We want to help the elderly be more digitally literate, however, it must be convenient and accessible to them. As of now, they have to go to many websites and find classes convenient for them.


# OUR IDEA/SOLUTION:
- Create a centralised website that can be used to showcase every possible digital upskilling workshop, that can be filtered by location and type of digital technology taught in the workshop.
- Workshop holders can post their available workshop on this centralised site, and people will be able to view and sign up for them.


# HOW OUR SOLUTION IS MEANT TO BE USED
- Dedicated to elderly with families, who are able to direct them to this website/ help them book via the website.
- A central hub for elderly to find ways to digitally up skill, (eg where to learn, what to learn, maybe even how to learn/start learning.)
- The website isnt meant to teach the elderly anything digital, it is solely meant to direct them to digital workshop providers
- Clicking into the desired workshop, makes for a smooth and easy sign up process for the workshop.  
- Corporations that want to teach workshops are are able to post their workshops on the website.
- Elderly/ Families of the elderly are able to browse through different workshops, based on locations, time, and organisation and suitability. 


# BONUS FEATURES AND IDEAS:
- Incorporating an AI model into the website for elderly to answer simple questions that they may have. The AI chatbot can be trained on various frequently asked questions.
- In the event that an elderly is unable to physically go to the workshop centre, they can have an agent from the workshop organisers team to go to their place and teach them.
- Website can unite those who have recently learnt about tech to form interest groups, or social gatherings to promote bonding between senior citizens of same location/ Age/ Gender/ Interests. 


# KEY CHALLENGES WE MAY FACE:
- Publicising the platform to 2 parties: Consumers (how to do for elderly?) and workshop organisers.
- Who will to manage, maintain and fund the website?
- What if one of these workshops are scams? (Can we use some form of fraud detection using Machine learning?). 


# THE PRODUCT AS A BUSINESS:
- Itâ€™s a social enterprise, meant for social good.
